# Production Line Intelligence Dashboard

A simulated manufacturing analytics project for tracking KPIs, downtime, and rework using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**.

---

## Project Purpose

This project showcases data science capabilities in a realistic production setting — simulating a full production line, generating operational data, and preparing it for business intelligence reporting.

**Tools:** `Python` · `pandas` · `matplotlib/seaborn` · `SQL` · `Power BI`  
**Skills:** KPI monitoring · Root cause analysis · Dashboarding · Data simulation · Operational analytics

## Phase 1: Define the Process + Simulate Data

We defined a 3-shift glass production process and simulated operational data using Python.

### Key Details:
- **Units produced**: 300  
- **Shifts**: 3 per day  
- **Product categories**: Doors, Walls, Flooring, Stairs, Partitions  
- **Metrics**:
  - Processing times (cutting, tempering, framing)
  - Downtime minutes
  - Quality check result + rework flag
  - Rework reason (for failures only)

### Files:
- `notebooks/01_data_simulation.ipynb` – Python code to simulate production data
- `data/production_data.csv` – Final output (ready for analysis)

---

## Next Steps

**Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Analyze trends by shift, product type, and rework outcomes.

---

## Project Goal

By the end, this dashboard will help:
- Monitor process efficiency and product quality
- Identify shifts or product types with high rework or downtime
- Demonstrate analytics and reporting skills using realistic operations data
